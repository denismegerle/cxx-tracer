# CXX-Tracer

This is a small, educational project in C++ to get familiar with the language on a deeper level.

Used concepts:
- C++ (basics, templates, ...)
- OMP/SIMD
- Cmake (setup, inclusion and generation of libraries, fetching, ...)
- 

## TODO
- add documentation generation via (xyz idk which stuff)
- maybe docker?
- add proper md with nice pictures (i.e two-three sample scenes)
- md : for each element i implemented one section, + future work at the end

- add readme and make it somehow useful with samples
- code maid cleanup
- remove warnings
- add sample pictures

## Implemented Features
This project implements a ray tracer with many basic features, with a random own maths/vector library.

### TODO1
### TODO2

## Future Work
- make transmission (in shadow rays) depth dependent instead of binary
- additional acceleration structure (kd-trees for instance)
- add trilinear filtering, anisotropic filtering and mip mapping
- add environment map filtering
- procedural textures, noise textures for cloud and mountain generation
